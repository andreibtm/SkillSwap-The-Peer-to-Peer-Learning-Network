# SkillSwap-The-Peer-to-Peer-Learning-Network
SkillSwap is a peer-to-peer micro-learning platform where users exchange knowledge instead of money. Each user lists the skills they can teach and the ones they want to learn, and our matching algorithm connects them for one-on-one or group sessions, online or in person.
